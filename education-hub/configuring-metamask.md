# üìö Configuring MetaMask

MetaMask wallet has shown to be effective for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, especially for use on the Binance Smart Chain.

### Installing MetaMask Wallet&#x20;

You can install MetaMask on Chrome and Firefox, or on IOS and Android if you‚Äôre a mobile user. The first thing you need to do is head over to the MetaMask [download page](https://metamask.io/download) and select the whichever platform you‚Äôre using. Then, follow the instructions to install it on your device. It is quite easy.&#x20;

The next step is to follow along with the setup specified by the app. Go ahead and click Create a Wallet. Make sure you write down your seed phrase somewhere secret. Ideally, it should not be on the Internet-connected device.&#x20;

Confirm that you have written your seed phrase down on the next page. Now, you‚Äôre good to go and your wallet is set up to receive and send funds.

### Connecting MetaMask to BSC Network



When you open your MetaMask wallet, you might notice that you‚Äôre still dealing with an Ethereum wallet. AT best, it will not work with Binance Smart Chain DApps. At worst, you can lose all your funds by sending them to addresses you cannot actually use. In order to change that, you need to follow a few easy steps depicted below.

**Step 1: Open your MetaMask wallet and go to **<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Settings**</mark>
